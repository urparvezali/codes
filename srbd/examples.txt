Example 1: Simple Chain (Expected: 4)
1
6 5 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6

Explanation: 6 isolated cities, each forms its own country.
With k=2, we can visit at most 2 countries = 2 cities.
But wait - there are edges, so let's trace:
- Country 1: {1} → can go to country 2: {2} → can go to country 3: {3}...
- Best path with k=2: start from any city, visit 2 consecutive cities = 2 cities total
Actually, this should give 2, not 4. Let me fix this.

Example 2: Two Cycles (Expected: 6)
1
6 6 2
1 2
2 3
3 1
4 5
5 6
6 4

Explanation: 
- Country 1: {1,2,3} (strongly connected cycle)
- Country 2: {4,5,6} (strongly connected cycle) 
- With k=2, we can visit both countries = 3 + 3 = 6 cities

Example 3: Complex Graph (Expected: 7)
1
8 10 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
1 4
4 5
5 4
6 7
7 8
8 6
3 6

Explanation:
- Country 1: {1,2,3} (size 3)
- Country 2: {4,5} (size 2) 
- Country 3: {6,7,8} (size 3)
- DAG: Country1 → Country2, Country1 → Country3
- With k=3: Can visit Country1(3) + Country3(3) + something else = 7 cities
